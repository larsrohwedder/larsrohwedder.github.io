I work as an Assistant Professor in Maastricht University (Netherlands).
Previously, I was a postdoc researcher in Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I am alumni of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).
I will serve or have served in the program committees of ICALP'24, [APPROX'23](https://approxconference.wordpress.com/), [SODA'23](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda23), and [WAOA'20](http://algo2020.di.unipi.it/WAOA2020/).
I am grateful for the NWO for funding my Open Competition M1 project "Twilight Zone of Efficiency: Optimality of Quasi-Polynomial Time Algorithms".

In my personal life, I'm married and I have two dogs and a cat. Some of my hobbies can be seen in the gallery below.
