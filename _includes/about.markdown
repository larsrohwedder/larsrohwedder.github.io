I work as an Assistant Professor in Maastricht University (Netherlands).
Previously, I was a postdoc researcher in Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I am alumni of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).
I will or have served in the program committees of SODA'23 and [WAOA'20](http://algo2020.di.unipi.it/WAOA2020/).

In my personal life, I'm married and I have two dogs and a cat. Some of my hobbies can be seen in the gallery below.
