I work as a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical computer science.
I am excited to be part of Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I also completed my B.Sc and M.Sc at CAU.
In 2015 I visited VMWare, Palo Alto (USA), for a 3-month internship.
In 2013 and 2014 I worked as an intern at Oracle, Redwood City (USA), for 7 and 2 months.
I am alumni of the Studienstiftung (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).
