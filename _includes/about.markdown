I work as a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical computer science.
I am excited to be part of Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I am alumni of the Studienstiftung (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).

In my personal life, I'm married and I have a dog and two cats.
