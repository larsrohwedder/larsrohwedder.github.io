### I will be moving to the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) in Odense soon! There I will work as an associate professor in the [algorithms group](https://algorithms.sdu.dk/).

Currently, I am an assistant professor in Maastricht University (Netherlands).
Previously, I was a postdoc researcher in Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I am alumni of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).
I will serve or have served in the program committees of STACS'25, [MAPSP'24](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~kirk/MAPSP/), [ICALP'24](https://compose.ioc.ee/icalp2024/), [APPROX'23](https://approxconference.wordpress.com/), [SODA'23](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda23), and [WAOA'20](http://algo2020.di.unipi.it/WAOA2020/).
I am grateful to the NWO for funding my Open Competition M1 project ``Twilight Zone of Efficiency: Optimality of Quasi-Polynomial Time Algorithms".
