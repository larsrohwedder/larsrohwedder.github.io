From January 2022 I will work as an Assistant Professor in Maastricht University (Netherlands).
At the moment I am a postdoc researcher in Ola Svensson's group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my Ph.D. in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) where I was
adviced by Klaus Jansen. I am alumni of the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation).
Recently I have served in the program committee of [WAOA'20](http://algo2020.di.unipi.it/WAOA2020/).

In my personal life, I'm married and I have two dogs and two cats. Some of my hobbies can be seen in the gallery below.
