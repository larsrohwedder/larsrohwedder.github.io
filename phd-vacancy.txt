The Operations Research group in the Quantitative Economics department of Maastricht University is seeking a PhD candidate within an NWO project on theory of algorithms, called "The Twilight Zone of Efficiency: Optimality of Quasi-Polynomial Time Algorithms".

The position is fully funded for four years (salary according to labor agreement of Dutch universities) and contains a moderate teaching load of at most 25%.

The applicant needs to hold a master's degree (or be close to completion) in mathematics, computer science, or similar. Strong mathematical skills (e.g., in writing formal proofs) are required. Prior experiences with approximation algorithms, scheduling, computational complexity, or fixed-parameter tractability are a plus. Good proficiency in English (both oral and written) is required; knowledge of Dutch is not necessary.
