Welcome to the course DM898 Parameterized Algorithms at IMADA, SDU!

This course provides knowledge of parameterized algorithms and related topics in operations research.

Students will get to know algorithmic paradigms for solving difficult problems to optimality. 

Students will work on a group project throughout the semester, in which they tackle a larger problem resembling using the methods they learned.
