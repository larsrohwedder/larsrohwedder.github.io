# Course notes

Weekly summary and slides, exercises from class

{% include collapse.html collapse="Week 36" content="
In the lecture on September 1st (see [slides](lecture1.pdf)), we discussed motivation for parameterized algorithms
and relation to Operation Research. Then we looked at the preprocessing rules for Vertex Cover as in Chapter 1 of the textbook.

In the lecture on September 3rd (see [slides](lecture2.pdf)), we discussed dynamic programming and in particular the algorithm for Steiner tree, see also Chapter~6.1.2 from the textbook.

The first [exercise sheet](sheet1.pdf) was given out. Please prepare solutions until Wednesday next week.
