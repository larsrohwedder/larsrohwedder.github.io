# Course notes

Weekly summary and slides, exercises from class

{% include collapse.html collapse="Week 36" content="
In the lecture on September 1st (see [slides](lecture1.pdf)), we discussed motivation for parameterized algorithms
and relation to Operation Research. Then we looked at the preprocessing rules for Vertex Cover as in Chapter 1 of the textbook.

In the lecture on September 3rd (see [slides](lecture2.pdf)), we discussed dynamic programming and in particular the algorithm for Steiner tree, see also Chapter~6.1.2 from the textbook.

The first [exercise sheet](exer1.pdf) was given out. Please prepare solutions until Wednesday next week.

In the lecture on September 10th, we discussed solutions to the first exercise set.
For the dynamic programming exercise, see also [Dynamic Program for Vertex Coloring](solution-coloring-dp.pdf).

In the lecture on September 11rd, we recalled basics from complexity theory by discussing the complexity questions from the first exercise sheet.

The second [exercise sheet](exer2.pdf) was given out. Please prepare solutions until Wednesday next week.

The lecture on September 17th unexpectedly did not happen.

In the lecture on September 18th, we started with the topic Kernelization and Preprocessing (see [slides](lecture3.pdf)). We covered Chapters 2.1 (formal definitions), 2.2.1 (Vertex Cover), and 2.2.3 (Edge Clique Cover) from the textbook. In the second half, we discussed solutions to exercise sheet 2.

The third [exercise sheet](exer3.pdf) was given out. Please prepare solutions until Friday next week.
