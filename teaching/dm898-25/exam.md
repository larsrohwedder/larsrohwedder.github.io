### Exam

This page collects information on the oral exam on January 29th.

## Basic information
- The oral exam takes at most 25 minutes.
- [Thore Husfeldt](https://thorehusfeldt.com/) will be present as the additional external examiner.
- There are no aids apart from the ones mentioned below in the topics. You will be able to draw on a blackboard/whiteboard
- First half: You will draw randomly a topics from the topics below. In around 6-8 minutes you briefly summarize the topic (see details below). Then you will be asked a few questions about it.
- Second half: The examiners will change to a second topic and ask you a few questions about this.
- Specific questions regarding your project may also be asked in the second part, possibly in the context of the topic.

## Topics
The following list will be extended until the last lecture of the course (estimated at December 10th)
- Preprocessing
    - Important: you know the basic definitions, the Sunflower Lemma, and you can give and explain examples of Kernelization algorithms and how they are analyzed
    - Less important: exactly reciting every rule for every problems (as long as you can give some examples)
- Branching
    - Important: be able to describe on a high level functioning of branching algorithms (and Branch-and-Bound), be able to give examples of branching algorithms and how they are analyzed, be able to explain Branch-and-Bound for ILPs
    - Less important: exactly reciting every detail for every problems (as long as you can give some examples)
- FPT via Linear Programming
    - Important: Basic ideas for Vertex Cover via LP relaxation, Eisenbrand-Weismantel algorithm, proximity and basic ideas behind proof (including Steinitz Lemma)
    - Less important: knowing by heart every detail of the proofs (as long as you can explain the high level intuition); other FPT results for ILP (Lenstra's algorithm, block structures)
    - **Aids**: In case you are asked to explain the Eisenbrand-Weismantel algorithm, you will be given the lecture slide
- Complexity Theory
    - Important: basic definitions (ETH, parameterized reductions), basic structure of proof of Sparsification Lemma, explaining approach for proving hardness of parameterized problems and giving examples
    - Less important: reciting calculations in the Sparsification Lemma, knowing reductions by heart
    - **Aids**: In case you are asked to explain the Sparsification Lemma, you will be given the lecture slide with the algorithm on it
- Treewidth
    - Important: basic definitions (path decomposition, tree decomposition), being able to construct a path/tree decomposition for a given graph, being able to explain (on a high level) how to apply dynamic programming on path/tree decompositions, Courcelle's Theorem, modelling problems in monadic second order logic
    - Less important: reciting details of the proof of recurrences

## Summary of randomly drawn topic
- You will briefly (6-8 minutes) explain a randomly drawn topic. You can use the blackboard/whiteboard
- You do not have to prepare a polished speech. Talk naturally
- Focus on high level (relevance of the topic in the context of the course, basic ideas)
- Be concise and keep what you write on blackboard/whiteboard short
