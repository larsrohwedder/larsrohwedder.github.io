### Programming Projects

| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------- |
| 06-02-2025 | 04-03-2025 |  System Call                | TBD            |

The projects are submitted in teams of two students (in exceptions: three). Each submission consists of **source code**, **report**, and **screen recording**.
- source code: 
- report: 
- screen recording:

Grading is done according to the following rubric. Different criteria are weighted differently. If one or more criteria are graded with *needs improvement*, a resit (second try) has to be done for the project. 
{% include table.html collapse="Show rubric" content="
| Criterion     | Excellent         |  Good                | Satisfactory        | Needs improvement        |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Functionality**: Are the required features implemented, correct, and presented in screen recording? | All features implemented correctly, if applicable optional/additional features | Major features implemented, no bugs or only minor bugs | Project can be run and some functionality visible | Project does not compile or does not run or does not behave in a sensible way |
| **Source code documentation and style** | Naming, indentation, comments consistent and according to industry standards | Code is easy to understand and contains solid documentation | Not enough documentation, but with some effort code is understandable | Code is very hard/impossible to understand |
| **Structure of report**: Are the contents of the report presented in logical order? Are the contents broken into reasonably small pieces/sections? Examples of typical sections are *introduction*, *conclusion*, *analysis*, *limitations*, etc., but different reports can require different types of sections | According to standards of scientific papers | Contents are structured in a sensible way | Some structure visible, but not enough to for convenient readability | Contents are arranged in a highly confusing way |
| **Language, typesetting, and formatting of report** | Typesetting and formatting comparable to scientific papers, little or no typos and grammar mistakes, writing is compact and precise | Careful writing, solid formatting and typesetting | Understandable, but contains many typos and grammar mistakes | Not understandable or AI generated |
| **Contents of report**: Explain what was done and why, if applicable explain what problems have occurred and possible limitations of solution | Challenges are identified and explained, several possible options are stated, design decisions are justified properly, results are discussed | Design decisions clearly documented, some amount of justification and analysis | It is understandable what was done in the project | It is not understandable how the goals of the project were addressed |

### Exam and Assessment

There is a written exam at the end of the course. It counts as 80% of the grade with
the remaining 20% coming from the the programming projects. Both parts have to be passed.

The topics of the exam are the following:
- The book chapters mentioned in the lecture list restricted to content discussed in lectures and exercise sessions (see slides and exercise sheets).
- Exam exercises comparable to those on exercise sheets
- One exercise to test rudimentary knowledge of topics from programming projects
