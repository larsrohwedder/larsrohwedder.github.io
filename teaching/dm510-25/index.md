Welcome to the course DM510 Operating Systems at IMADA, SDU!

This course provides knowledge of the structure of computer systems, the interplay of hardware and software,
the role of operating systems in this task, and the resource abstractions provided by an operating system.

Students will gain knowledge about actual operating systems, scheduling algorithms, security and protection mechanisms,
file systems and process communication.

Students will work on several programming assignments (system call, kernel module for a device drive, file system).
