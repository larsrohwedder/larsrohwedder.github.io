Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, Greg Gagne: [Operating System Concepts 10th edition](https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/os-book/OS10/index.html), Wiley, 2018.

Note, that there is an International and a US version of the book. It should not be important if you use the US or the international version.

### Course-Specific Instructions

For the programming projects you need access to a computer or virtual machine running Linux. If you have a computer that runs Linux, you can use that. Other options are to use remote access to the IMADA virtual computer lab or to install a virtual machine on your own computer (running a potentially different operating system).
- [IMADA virtual computer lab](lab)
- [Installing a virtual machine](vm)
In the projects we are using User-Mode Linux. A guide on getting started with it can be found below.
- [User-Mode Linux](uml)
For the projects you also need to get familiar with system calls in linux. Below is a guideline on implementing a trivial system call
- [System call in linux](syscall)
