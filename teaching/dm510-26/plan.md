### Exam, grading, and repeat students

There is a written exam at the end of the course (June 4th for first try and August 12th for second try).
The exam counts as 80% of the final grade with
the remaining 20% coming from the the programming projects. Both parts have to be passed.

The topics of the exam are the following:
- The book chapters mentioned in the lecture list restricted to content discussed in lectures and exercise sessions (see slides and exercise sheets).
- C and Linux topics as seen in exercise sessions and projects
- Exam exercises comparable to those on exercise sheets

Repeat students who have participated in the course and successfully passed the projects may transfer those partial grades without doing the projects again. Please confirm this by emailing the teacher.
