### Exam, grading, and repeat students

There is a written exam at the end of the course (June 13th for first try and August 6th for second try).
The exam counts as 80% of the final grade with
the remaining 20% coming from the the programming projects. Both parts have to be passed.

The topics of the exam are the following:
- The book chapters mentioned in the lecture list restricted to content discussed in lectures and exercise sessions (see slides and exercise sheets).
- Exam exercises comparable to those on exercise sheets
- One exercise to test rudimentary knowledge of topics from programming projects

Repeat students who have participated in the course in previous years will need to submit the projects again.
In case they want to reuse their own submissions from the previous year (adapted to the changes if necessary), they should submit it alone.
