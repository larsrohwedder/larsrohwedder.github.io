I"Ê<p>I work as a postdoctoral researcher for theoretical computer science.
I am excited to be part of Ola Svenssonâ€™s group at EPFL, Lausanne (Switzerland).
Before that I have received my PhD in computer science at CAU, Kiel (Germany) adviced by Klaus Jansen,
where I also graduated with a M.Sc.
In 2015 I visited VMWare, Palo Alto (USA), for a 3-month internship.
In 2013 and 2014 I worked as an intern at Oracle, Redwood City (USA), for 7 and 2 months.</p>
