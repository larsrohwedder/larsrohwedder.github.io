  My goal is to devise algorithms that solve important problems efficiently.
  I am broadly interested in topics from combinatorial optimization including
  approximative algorithms, online algorithms, parameterized algorithms, and integer programming.
awards:
  - I was admitted a scholarship by the Studienstiftung (German Academic Scholarship Foundation), a prestigious German organization that supports exceptionally talented students.
  - I won the award for the best Ph.D. in the year 2019 by the ``Förderverein der TF'' of the University of Kiel.
  - My Master's degree was among the three best (by grade) within the graduating class.
  - My Bachelor's degree was the best (by grade).

  I have been in the program committee of WAOA'20 and I am regularly peer-reviewing for various conferences and journals. I contributed a significant part to the successful DFG (German research foundation)
  project proposal ``Entwicklung von Approximationsalgorithmen für Scheduling auf heterogenen Maschinen'' by my Ph.D. advisor Klaus Jansen.
